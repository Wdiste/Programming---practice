            <p>The first thing to learn about react is... What is it?</p>
            <p>When coding websites, we know that the main languages are HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  React is a ui
               library for building dynamic components. Html is a static language and cannot change itself which
               means if you want to show new information after an event occurs you must load an entirely different 
               page.  With the help of some clever javascript, prebuilt html can be replaced and reloaded, but 
               React takes things to the next level.  Learn to make a basic website that immediately updates with 
               the power of react!
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="intro">
            <header>Introduction</header>
            <p>React is just a library for the Javascript language, so before getting started, a few prerequisites are 
               needed.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                    <p>HTML is the static component of websites. This is the blueprint of the page and contains all the
                       data to be displayed.  A basic understanding of HTML elements and syntax is needed because JSX, javascript XML,
                       is a modified way of writing Javascript that closely resembles HTML elemeents.
                    </p>
                <li>CSS</li>
                    <p>CSS is the design element of web pages. If HTML is the engineering blueprint, CSS is the archetectural
                       flair. After laying out your data in HTML, CSS is needed to style a page, usually to make the data easier to digest.
                       React is no different in that you must still decorate the page in your desired dtyle. Similar to React, css 
                       has its own abundance of libraries and technologies to help with design. (Bootstrap and Tailwind are two popular ones)
                    </p>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                    <p>Javascript is the dynamic portion of a website. This language is what allows for interaction with the HTML.
                       Click on a button? Javascript. Slide a volume slider? Javascript. Submit a login form? Javascript.  When using React, 
                       HTML is replaced with a split for of Javascript/HTML called JSX.  Basically, all static data is written in the Javascript 
                       file, allowing it to be updated.  JS syntax is important to know because that's where the bulk of React is written.
                    </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="create">
            <header>Create react app</header>
            <p>With the skills listed above, you will have everything you need to use React. In addition to skills, 
               you will need Node.js for your ide in order to get started.
            </p>
            <p>To begin, we will use the terminal commands to build an app. Traditionally, <code>npm create-react-app</code> &lt;your-directory&gt; was used 
               to easily build a React app.  This method is still viable but many are switching to <code>npm create vite@latest</code>, which is suggested 
               to build faster and be more effecient as projects grow larger in scale. Choose either method, but vite is considered  more up to date 
               as create-react-app has not been updated in some time. After entering the creation command in the terminal, your app will be constructed 
               with the basics of what you need.

        <section class="main-section" id="components">
            <header>Components</header>
            <p>A big part of using react is understanding components. A component can be thought of as a blueprint for an 
               HTML page. For example, if you wanted to create a timer, you would create an HTML doc describing the timer display.
               If you wanted to create a flash card for studying, you would write HTML and design your flash card with the question and corresponding answer. 
               Now under normal circumstances, these two documents would exist seperate from eachother. What good is a timer if the 
               device that the timer is in charge of is on a different page?
            </p>
            <p>This is where React comes in. Now these two seperate files can appear on the same page and be updated individually 
               without refreshing the app. The following is an example of such a combination:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    export default function MyApp() {
                        return (
                        &lt;div&gt;
                            &lt;h1&gt;Flash card test!&lt;/h1&gt;
                            &lt;MyTimer /&gt;
                            &lt;MyFlashCard /&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        );
                    }</code>
            </pre>
            <p>Here we can see that both the <code>&lt;MyTimer&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;MyFlashCard&gt;</code> components 
               exist in the same document. The extra benefit in this is that each components retains its own scripts. Therefore, 
               as long as your JS is functioning, the timer is activated it will countdown in realtime and will interact with the 
               flashcard as designed. (e.g. reveal the answer after a given time)
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="router">
            <header>React router</header>
            <p>Another big cog in the React machine is the router. A simplified explanation is that traditionally, a change 
               of page requires a new seerver request and thus a reload of the page. React handles this by fetching data not from 
               a server, but from the app itself to instantly update data. An example of router code looks like this:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
                    import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
                    import MyTimer from "./pages/MyTimer";
                    import MyFlashcard from "./pages/MyFlashcard";
                    import Home from "./pages/Home";

                    export default function App() {
                    return (
                        &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
                        &lt;Routes&gt;
                            &lt;Route path="/" element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;
                            &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;} /&gt;
                            &lt;Route path="myTimer" element={&lt;MyTimer /&gt;} /&gt;
                            &lt;Route path="myFlashCard" element={&lt;MyFlashCard /&gt;} /&gt;
                            &lt;Route path="*" element={&lt;Home /&gt;} /&gt;
                            &lt;/Route&gt;
                        &lt;/Routes&gt;
                        &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
                    );
                    }

                    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
                    root.render(&lt;App /&gt;);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>This code may seem confusing at first, but once it is set up it will do all the heavy lifting 
               for any pages you code. Understanding routing in vanilla JS will make this setup easier as well.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="state">
            <header>What is state?</header>
            <p>The final major concept we will cover is State. When using React, a special kind of variable exists 
               called State. Until you get used to using State, it will be a difficult concept to grasp. UseState is 
               whats called a Hook, which is a method react uses to access features and parts of other components. 
               Put simply, a state is a variable which is set and changed on an event. In the flashcard example, state 
               could be used like this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Syntax: <code>const [state, setState] = useState(initial value);</code></li>
                <li>
                    'state' will be replaced by whatever you name the variable. When used in the code, this will refer to the 
                    value currently set.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'setState' refers to the method used to change the value of 'state'. For example, if using colors as a state 
                    variable, you can change the state to 'red' by using <code>setState('red');</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'useState' is the initial value given to the variable 'state'. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import React, { useState } from "react"; //State must be imported with React
                    function flashcardGame() {
                        cosnt questionList = [question 1, question 2...] //array loaded with questions
                        const [question, setQuestion] = useState(0);     
                        //initial state will be 0 to begin at first question in array

                        &lt;button&gt; type="button" onClick={() => setQuestion(9)}>Skip to question 10&lt;/button&gt;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>State can be used in many powerful ways such as sharing variables between components and conditionally rendering 
               components.
